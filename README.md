=======
If you want to see a preview of this product on your computer (localhost)...

Download files into your computer and put it in a folder named, "Skillit".

Terminal
Change directory to your folder (Skillit)
type: python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Now your http server will start in port 8000

On your web browser, type this into the URL: http://localhost:8000/

voila

As for windows machines, I don't know how to do this yet -- maybe someone else can look into this.
