If you want to see a preview of this product on your computer (localhost)...

Download files into your computer and put it in a folder named, "Skillit".

Terminal<br>
Change directory to your folder (Skillit)<br>
type: python -m SimpleHTTPServer<br>
Now your http server will start in port 8000

On your web browser, type this into the URL: http://localhost:8000/

voila!

As for windows machines, I don't know how to do this yet -- maybe someone else can look into this.

I used LinkedIn JavaScript API framework and not RESTful OAuth implemention. Therefore, do not mind these files:<br> header_OAuth.html<br> 
linkedin_redirect.html<br>
js/Oauth.js<br>
